# S0001-configuration — Configuration

## Problem

Each project must start in the same way in each environment, with its settings outside the code.

### User Stories

- As an operator, I want **to set each project with environment variables** so that one build operates in each environment.
- As a developer, I want **an incorrect setting to stop the project when it starts** so that I never examine a system with an incomplete configuration.

### Business rules

- Each setting must have a documented default.
- A project must stop cleanly: it must not lose a request in progress or a log line.

### Out of context

- The log and the error format (`monitoring`), the health status (`health`).
- The management of secrets. Configuration files, other than an optional local `.env` file.

## Requirements

- **R01**: WHEN the `back` starts with `PORT` set, it SHALL accept HTTP connections on that port.
- **R02**: WHEN the `back` starts without `PORT`, it SHALL accept HTTP connections on port 3000.
- **R03**: WHEN the `front` starts with `PORT` set, it SHALL serve its application at `/` on that port.
- **R04**: WHEN the `front` starts without `PORT`, it SHALL serve its application at `/` on port 4000.
- **R05**: WHEN a project starts with a `PORT` that is not an integer from 1 to 65535, it SHALL stop with a non-zero exit code and a message that contains `PORT`.
- **R06**: WHEN a request to the `back` has an `Origin` header that `CORS_ORIGIN` contains, the `back` SHALL answer with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to that origin.
- **R07**: WHILE `CORS_ORIGIN` is not set, the `back` SHALL answer each request with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.
- **R08**: WHEN the `front` starts with `API_BASE_URL` set, `GET /runtime-config.json` SHALL answer 200 with `{ "apiBaseUrl": "<that URL>" }`.
- **R09**: WHEN the `back` starts, it SHALL apply each migration that the database does not have, in order, and record the version of each one.
- **R10**: IF the database has a schema version that the `back` does not know, THEN the `back` SHALL stop with a non-zero exit code and a message that contains that version.

## Expected URLs and APIs

| Kind | Project | Address | Expected answer | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| api | back | any path on `PORT` | An HTTP response with the CORS header | R01, R02, R06, R07 |
| page | front | `/` on `PORT` | The application document | R03, R04 |
| api | front | `GET /runtime-config.json` | 200 `{ "apiBaseUrl": "..." }`. No error status. | R08 |
| process | back | start on a database | Applies the missing migrations, or stops on an unknown version | R09, R10 |

## Solution

### back

- Settings: `PORT` (3000), `HOST` (all interfaces), `DATABASE_URL` (a local default), `CORS_ORIGIN` (comma list, `*`).
- `core` reads and checks each setting one time, before it opens the port, with the shared primitives `readSetting` and `parseInteger`. It adds them when they do not exist. `parseInteger` gets the variable name as its field, so its error names the variable. No project writes its own integer check. `shared` never reads settings.
- A relative path in a setting starts at the project folder, never at the working directory.
- `core` opens the database from `DATABASE_URL`. The composition gives it to the features through its contract in `shared`.
- Migrations: one numbered file for each schema change (`0001-{name}`), all in one folder; a feature adds its own there. The runner of `core` applies each missing one before the port opens, each in one transaction, and records its version and time. No feature creates a table.
- Clean stop, checked by `review-implementation` (a stop signal is not the same on each operating system): on a stop signal, no new connection, the requests in progress complete, the queued log lines are written, the database closes, exit code 0. After a short timeout: stop them, non-zero exit code.

### front

- `PORT` (4000), `API_BASE_URL` (`http://localhost:3000`).
- `core` serves `GET /runtime-config.json`. The HTTP client reads it one time at startup and is the only user of `API_BASE_URL`. No build for each environment.

### e2e

- For each project under test (`BACK` or `FRONT`), `core` reads `{PROJECT}_DIRECTORY` (default: its source folder, `../back` or `../front`), `{PROJECT}_PORT` (3000 back, 4000 front, written one time in `core`), `{PROJECT}_START` (default: its `start` slot) and `E2E_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` (15000). An invalid value stops the suite; it never falls back to the default.
- Without `{PROJECT}_PORT`, the suite starts the project without `PORT`, so the project uses its own default.
- Checked by `review-implementation`, not by a test: a project that answers on its port is used, never started a second time; otherwise the suite starts it, waits, and stops it after the run, also after a failure or a timeout, so that no process of the suite stays alive; an invalid setting or a timeout stops the suite before the first test, with the variable or the project and the cause.
- `core` gives the base URLs to the tests through the runner configuration. Tests read them through the fixtures in `shared`, never write a port or a URL, and get a free port from `shared`.
- A helper in `shared` (a shared primitive) starts one project with an environment that the test gives, and returns its output, exit code, base URL and stop operation. `core` uses it too.
- Each instance that a test starts has its own temporary database when the test gives no `DATABASE_URL`. The helper never takes `DATABASE_URL` from the environment of the runner, and deletes the database after the stop. No retries and no single worker to hide a shared database.

### All projects

- An example environment file lists each variable and its default.

## Schema impact

| Schema | Element | Change | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| back.db | table of applied versions | new | `version`, `appliedAt`. One row for each applied migration. |

## Test notes

- **R01, R03, R05, R08**: start an own instance with the helper, on a free port, with no browser.
- **R02, R04**: use the instance that the suite started without `PORT`; its base URL has the default port.
- **R09**: start on a new temporary database, stop, start again on it: no version has two rows.
- **R10**: record an unknown version in a temporary database before the start.
